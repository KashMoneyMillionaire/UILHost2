========

UILHost is a web application tool for teachers in Texas to use to manage UIL Academic meets.

The teacher(s) in charge of a meet (Coordinators) will be able to send invites to schools, choose which events are available
for a meet, and many other tasks. UILHost will keep track of student's scores, rank the students on their performance, and keep
track of all the meticulous drivle that takes up so much time.
